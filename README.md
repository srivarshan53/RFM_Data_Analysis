# RFM_Data_Analysis
RFM Analysis is performed especially in the marketing domain for understanding and segmenting customers based on their buying behaviour.
Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customers’:
•	Recency (the date they made their last purchase)
•	Frequency (how often they make purchases)
•	Monetary value (the amount spent on purchases)
Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value of a customer are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.
